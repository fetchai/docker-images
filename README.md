This repository simplifies usage of docker in general, but mainly for purposes of development.

The setup is done the way that it supports comfortable development - you can edit files locally on your host OS, and just build & run binaries in docker. Build & run is simplifiead to bare minimum so you won't feel any overhead in terms of number of commands/steps you need to perform, or performance, comparing to building & runing stuff directly on local host OS.

**Note 1:** Please see the [Docker](#docker_inst_setup) section at the end of this document how to **install and setup** the docker component.<br/>
**Note 2:** Please configure your local git settings based on [this guide](README_git_setup.md).

Usage (quick guide)<a name="guick_usage_guide"></a>
===================

1. We first need to build our `develop` docker image locally on our host OS:
    ```bash
    ./develop-image/scripts/docker-build-img.sh
    ```
1. Start `bash` shell in docker container based on our `devlop` image:
    ```bash
    ./develop-image/scripts/docker-run.sh bash
    ```

1. Run `make` helper:
    ```bash
    ./develop-image/scripts/docker-make.sh [NON-MANDATORY_PARAMS_FOR_MAKE]
    ```

Concept
=======

1. Each docker image setup **MUST** have its own dedicated directory. Lets assume, for ilustrational purposes of this guide that directory name will be the `my_image`.

2. This dedicated directory (`my_image`) **MUST** contain following things at minumum (and can contain anything else):
   * **`scripts`** directory
      - this directory can be provided either by **symlink** pointing to git repo `scripts` dir (which is suggested way), or by copy (discouraged).
   * **`docker-env.sh`** file
      - this file defines set of environment variables which define docker image setup for building & usage.
      - scripts from `scripts` direcory need this file to be present at this location (parent folder of `scripts` folder) since they are using enviroment variables defined by this file for they operations.

3. Scripts can be executed from anywhere (any directory on host OS filesystem).

   However, be aware that `docker-run.sh` and `docker-make.sh` scripts mount **current working directory** from host OS filesystem as volume in to the docker running container, making it available (read & write) in the running container.
   
The `docker-env.sh` file
========================

This file defines the docker image setup for building, deployment and running.

It allows to set small set of environment variables which are used by scripts, where only one env var is mandatory to be set really.

The `scripts/docker-env.template.sh` file is template which is supposed to be used by copy to create new `docker-env.sh` file in to its own dedicated directory. Please refer to this file to get list of variables and detailed description.

Example how to create new image & use scripts with it
=====================================================

> Creating new image
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images.git
cd docker-images
mkdir my_image
cd my_image
ln -s ../scripts scripts

## EITHER copy temaple file and edit it manually:
#cp ../scripts/docker-env.template.sh docker-env.sh
## (then edit it manually by setting DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=my_image:latest)
## OR execute following line:
echo "DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=my_image:latest" > docker-env.sh

# Create trivial dockerfile:
echo "FROM centos/devtoolset-4-toolchain-centos7:latest" > Dockerfile

# Commit to git if desired:
#git add .
#git commit -m "Addin my_image"
```

> Building new image:
```bash
cd docker-images
my_image/scripts/docker-build-img.sh
```

> Publishing (pushing) newly created image to docker registry:
```bash
cd docker-images
my_image/scripts/docker-publish-img.sh
```

> Pulling image from docker registry = no necessity to build it locally (the first step above) if it was already published in to external docker registry:
```bash
cd docker-images
my_image/scripts/docker-pull-img.sh
```

> Starting executable in docker container. We start `bash` shell in this example, which is very convenient since it remains running and user can interactively execute commands in running docker container from there:
```bash
cd docker-images
my_image/scripts/docker-run.sh bash
```

> Direct execution of build (the `make` in this specific example, but it can be changed in the `docker-env.sh` file). This is just convenience command - it spins up container, executes build process in there, and exits the container.
```bash
cd docker-images
my_image/scripts/docker-make.sh --help
```

Advanced examples of scripts usage
==================================

Some scripts allow to provide parameters for docker and additional stuff. Please refer to specific scripts to get details if they support additional parameters, if they do they contain comment section at the top of the script with usage & examples.

NOTE: PLease note that the **standalone** `--` parameter (with whitespace characters around it from **both** sides) separates parameters to two groups: parameters listed to the left of it will form the "left" group and will be send to `docker` command (meaning they need to conform to parameters defined by `docker` command line manual), and the parameters listed to the right of it will form the "right" group and will be provided for the purpose whcih contextually matches the script meaning - please see examples bellow for detailed explanation.

> Advanced usage of the `docker-build-img.sh`
```bash
cd docker-images

my_image/scripts/docker-build-img.sh --squash --cpus 4 --compress --

# Above commandline example recognise the `--squash --cpus 4 --compress` parameters as
# the `left` group (to the left of the standalone `--` parameter) and will be sent 
# to the `docker build` command as IMMEDIATE_PARAMS (see bellow). The `right` group of
# parameters will be empty (as there are no paremeters provided to the right of the
# standalone `--` parameter) and will be set to the TAIL_PARAMS (= empty value), see
# bellow.
# Where general definition of the low level docker build commandline is:
#   docker build $IMMEDIATE_PARAMS -t $DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG $TAIL_PARAMS $DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT_DIR
# ==> And so the the resulting docker commandline (after substitution) will be:
#   docker build --squash --cpus 4 --compress -t $DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG $DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT_DIR
#, where DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG and DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT_DIR variables will be provided by 
# scripts infrastructure (by `docker-env.sh` and `docker-env-common.sh`).
```

> Advanced usage of the `docker-run.sh`
```bash
cd docker-images

my_image/scripts/docker-run.sh -p 8080:80 --cpus 4 -d -- build/examples/http_server -p 80

# Above commandline example provides the `-p 8080:80 --cpus 4 -d` parameters to `docker run`
# command as DOCKER_PARAMS, and the `build/examples/http_server -p 80` as the EXECUTABLE_PARAMS,
# where low level docker run commandline is:
#   docker run -i $USE_TTY -w $WORKDIR --rm $DOCKER_PARAMS -v $(pwd):$WORKDIR $DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG $EXECUTABLE_PARAMS
# ==> And so the the resulting docker process commandline will be:
#   docker run -i $USE_TTY -w $WORKDIR --rm -p 8080:80 --cpus 4 -d -t $DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG build/examples/http_server -p 80
#, where values for USE_TTY, WORKDIR and DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG variables will be provided by
# scripts infrastructure (by `docker-env.sh` and `docker-env-common.sh`)
#
# NOTE: The `-p 8080:80` parameter exposes internal docker container network port 80
# to host OS network port 8080, what makes it externally accessible from host OS where
# docker container is running. And `-d` param will ensure that docker runtime will
# start the `build/examples/http_server` process in daemon mode (docker cli won't exit
# until at least one daemon processes is running).
```

Docker <a name="docker_inst_setup"></a>
=======================================

The advantage of using the `Docker` is absolutely stable and reproducible setup (what is definitely important for test environment, but also for development and production environments) no matter what host OS setup is. Advantage is that this avoids necessity to install & maintain all necessary components directly on host OS (e.g. whole build chain, dependencies, tools, etc.) - this is done in docker and so it will eliminate issue with differencies of setup on different development machines, etc. ... 

## Installation
Download the Docker (Community Edition) installtion package for your plafrom from https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community (or alternativelly use more general https://www.docker.com/community-edition instead if the previous link does not work for you) and install it.

## Setup
Find Docker icon in system status bar (on Mac OS X top right side of the screen, or bottom right on Windows OS). Rightclick on the the `Preferences`. There go to the `Advanced` tab where pull all resources to the maximum (CPU, Memory, Swap, etc. ...), don't worry Docker will use on demand (momentarily) only as much resources as it actually needs, what means it immediatelly releases resources which are not used.
If your network setup needs to use proxy, it can be done in the `Proxies` tab.
==> **Click at `Apply & Restart` to reflect changes**, Docker daemon will restartfully is 
, wait until the daemon is fully up & running again.
